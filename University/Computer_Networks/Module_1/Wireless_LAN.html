The back-off timer is used to manage delays before attempting to transmit, helping to reduce the chance of collisions in a busy network.</li> </ul> <h3 id="3-persistence-strategy">3. <strong>Persistence Strategy</strong></h3> <ul> <li>The device applies a persistence strategy, which determines how it senses the medium. In CSMA/CA, the device listens to the wireless medium to check if it’s idle or busy (carrier sensing).</li> </ul> <h3 id="4-wait-difs">4. <strong>Wait DIFS</strong></h3> <ul> <li>DIFS stands for Distributed Interframe Space, a specific time interval that the device must wait before attempting to transmit. This ensures that the medium has been idle long enough to proceed, giving priority to other types of traffic (like acknowledgments or control frames) that use shorter interframe spaces.</li> </ul> <h3 id="5-send-rts">5. <strong>Send RTS</strong></h3> <ul> <li>If the medium is idle after DIFS, the device sends a Request to Send (RTS) frame.

DIFS is a longer interframe space that gives priority to control frames and ensures the medium is clear.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>RTS (Request to Send)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The source sends an RTS frame to the destination. This frame signals the source’s intent to transmit data and reserves the medium, helping to avoid collisions, especially in scenarios with hidden nodes (devices that can’t hear each other).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>SIFS (Short Interframe Space)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>After receiving RTS, the destination waits a shorter SIFS period before responding. SIFS is used for high-priority, time-sensitive responses like CTS, ensuring quick acknowledgment without interference.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>CTS (Clear to Send)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The destination responds with a CTS frame, indicating it is ready to receive data. The CTS frame also helps reserve the medium and informs other nearby devices (including hidden nodes) to back off.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Data</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>After receiving CTS, the source sends the actual data frame to the destination, again separated by an SIFS interval to maintain priority and minimize delays.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>ACK (Acknowledgment)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The destination, after receiving the data, waits another SIFS period and sends an ACK frame back to the source, confirming successful reception of the data.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>DIFS Again</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>After the ACK, the medium is free again, and the source (or any other device) must wait DIFS before attempting another transmission.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="3-network-allocation-vector-nav-and-other-stations">3. <strong>Network Allocation Vector (NAV) and Other Stations</strong></h3> <ul> <li>The right part of the diagram shows how “All other stations” (other devices in the network) behave during this transmission.</li> <li>When other stations hear the RTS or CTS frames, they set their Network Allocation Vector (NAV), represented by the yellow box labeled “NAV (No carrier sensing).”</li> <li>The NAV is a virtual timer that indicates the medium is busy for a specific duration, preventing these stations from transmitting during that time. This helps avoid collisions by ensuring other devices remain silent while the source and destination complete their communication.</li> <li>The NAV is set based on the duration field in the RTS and CTS frames, which specifies how long the medium will be occupied (including time for data and ACK transmission).</li> </ul> <h3 id="4-purpose-of-csmaca-and-nav">4. <strong>Purpose of CSMA/CA and NAV</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>CSMA/CA</strong>: This protocol minimizes collisions in wireless networks by having devices sense the medium (carrier sensing) and use random back-offs (as seen in the previous flowchart). The RTS/CTS mechanism adds an extra layer of collision avoidance, particularly for hidden node problems, where two devices might not hear each other but could interfere with a common destination.</li> <li><strong>NAV</strong>: The Network Allocation Vector ensures that all stations in the network respect the reservation of the medium, even if they can’t directly sense the carrier (e.g., due to distance or interference). This improves efficiency and reduces the likelihood of collisions in a busy Wi-Fi network.</li> </ul> <h2 id="repetition-interval"><strong>Repetition Interval</strong></h2> <p><img src="/static/Pasted-image-20250223182529.png" alt="Pasted-image-20250223182529"></p> <h3 id="1-key-components">1. <strong>Key Components</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>AP (Access Point)</strong>: The central device managing the wireless network, responsible for coordinating access to the medium in PCF mode.</li> <li><strong>Polled Station</strong>: A specific station (e.g., a device like a laptop) that the AP polls to allow it to transmit data.</li> <li><strong>Others</strong>: Other stations in the network that are not currently polled but are part of the network.</li> <li><strong>Time</strong>: The horizontal axis represents the progression of time, with events occurring from left to right.</li> <li><strong>Repetition Interval</strong>: The overall time period during which the contention-free period (CFP) occurs, followed by a contention period (CP).</li> </ul> <h3 id="2-sequence-of-events-in-the-repetition-interval">2. <strong>Sequence of Events in the Repetition Interval</strong></h3> <p>The diagram shows a structured sequence of frames and timing intervals within the repetition interval, which alternates between contention-free and contention periods:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Beacon Frame (B)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The repetition interval begins with the AP broadcasting a Beacon frame (shown in pink). Beacons are periodic management frames that synchronize the network, announce the network’s presence, and indicate the start of the contention-free period (CFP).</li> <li>The Beacon is sent after a PIFS (PCF Interframe Space), which is shorter than DIFS and gives the AP priority to access the medium.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poll</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>After the Beacon, the AP sends a Poll frame (also in pink) to a specific polled station, granting it permission to transmit data. This is part of the contention-free service, where the AP controls access to avoid collisions.</li> <li>The Poll is separated from the Beacon by an SIFS (Short Interframe Space), ensuring quick and prioritized communication.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>ACK + Data</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The polled station responds with an acknowledgment (ACK) and its data frame (shown in blue), also separated by an SIFS. This ensures the AP knows the data was received, and the data transmission happens without contention.</li> <li>The ACK and data are combined into one frame for efficiency in this context.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>ACK + CF-Poll (Contention-Free Poll)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The AP acknowledges the data with an ACK and sends another CF-Poll (Contention-Free Poll) frame (in pink) to either the same station or another station, allowing further contention-free transmission.</li> <li>This process can repeat, with dots (“...”) indicating potential additional polls until the end of the contention-free period.</li> <li>The contention-free period ends with a CF-End frame, signaling that the medium is now available for contention-based access.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Contention Period (CP)</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>After the contention-free period, the network switches to the contention period, where devices use CSMA/CA (as shown in previous diagrams) to compete for medium access, potentially leading to collisions but allowing flexibility for all devices.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="3-network-allocation-vector-nav">3. <strong>Network Allocation Vector (NAV)</strong></h3> <ul> <li>The yellow box labeled “NAV” at the bottom represents the Network Allocation Vector for other stations (those not polled).</li> <li>During the contention-free period, other stations set their NAV based on the Beacon or Poll frames, indicating that the medium is busy.

This problem occurs in wireless networks when two or more stations are within range of a common receiver but out of range of each other, potentially causing collisions at the receiver. The RTS/CTS handshake, part of the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) protocol, mitigates this issue by reserving the wireless medium and notifying all relevant stations, even those that can’t hear each other. Let’s break it down:</p> <hr> <h3 id="what-is-the-hidden-station-problem"><strong>What is the Hidden Station Problem?</strong></h3> <ul> <li>The hidden station problem arises when, for example, Station B and Station C can both communicate with Station A (the receiver) but cannot detect each other’s transmissions because they are out of range or separated by obstacles (e.g., walls).</li> <li>If B and C transmit to A simultaneously, their signals collide at A, corrupting the data, even though B and C don’t realize a collision is occurring because they can’t hear each other.</li> <li>This is a limitation of CSMA/CA’s carrier sensing, as stations rely on listening to the medium before transmitting, but hidden stations won’t detect each other’s activity.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="how-handshaking-rtscts-prevents-the-hidden-station-problem"><strong>How Handshaking (RTS/CTS) Prevents the Hidden Station Problem</strong></h3> <p>The RTS/CTS handshake adds an explicit medium reservation step to CSMA/CA, ensuring that all stations near the receiver are aware of an impending transmission, even if they can’t hear the sender. Here’s how it works, as illustrated in Figure 14.11 from your diagrams:</p> <h4 id="1-rts-request-to-send"><strong>1. RTS (Request to Send)</strong></h4> <ul> <li>A station wanting to transmit (e.g., Station B) first sends an RTS frame to the intended receiver (e.g., Station A).</li> <li>The RTS frame includes: <ul> <li>The MAC address of the sender (B) and receiver (A).</li> <li>A Duration field specifying how long the medium will be busy for the upcoming transmission (including time for CTS, data, and ACK frames).</li> </ul> </li> <li>B sends the RTS only after ensuring the medium is idle for a DIFS (Distributed Interframe Space) period, as per CSMA/CA.</li> </ul> <h4 id="2-cts-clear-to-send"><strong>2. CTS (Clear to Send)</strong></h4> <ul> <li>If Station A receives the RTS successfully, it responds with a CTS frame after a short SIFS (Short Interframe Space) interval.</li> <li>The CTS frame includes: <ul> <li>The MAC address of the sender of the RTS (B, now the receiver of the data).</li> <li>The same Duration value from the RTS, indicating how long the medium will remain busy.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The CTS is broadcast and can be heard by all stations within A’s transmission range, including any hidden stations (e.g., Station C) that couldn’t hear B’s RTS.</li> </ul> <h4 id="3-nav-network-allocation-vector"><strong>3. NAV (Network Allocation Vector)</strong></h4> <ul> <li>Stations that hear the CTS (e.g., C) set their Network Allocation Vector (NAV), a virtual timer that indicates the medium is busy for the specified duration.</li> <li>This prevents C (and other stations within A’s range) from transmitting during this period, avoiding a collision at A even though C couldn’t hear B’s RTS.</li> </ul> <h4 id="4-data-and-ack"><strong>4. Data and ACK</strong></h4> <ul> <li>After receiving CTS, B sends its data frame to A, followed by A sending an ACK (Acknowledgment) frame to confirm successful reception.</li> <li>The NAV ensures that no other stations interfere during this exchange, protecting the transmission from hidden stations like C.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="exposed-station-problem"><strong>Exposed Station Problem?</strong></h2> <p>The exposed station problem occurs in wireless networks when a station (device) unnecessarily delays or defers its transmission because it detects activity on the medium, even though its transmission wouldn’t interfere with the ongoing communication. This leads to reduced network efficiency and throughput, as the station waits when it could safely transmit without causing collisions.</p> <h3 id="key-characteristics"><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Stations Involved</strong>: Consider three stations: Station B, Station A, and Station D. B and D are within range of A, but B and D are not within range of each other.</li> <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: If A is transmitting data to B, Station D (within A’s range) senses the medium as busy and defers its transmission. However, D’s transmission to another station (e.g., not shown in the diagram) wouldn’t interfere with A’s communication to B, as D is out of B’s range.</li> <li><strong>Problem</strong>: D is “exposed” to A’s transmission but unnecessarily restricted from transmitting, wasting potential network capacity and reducing efficiency.</li> </ul> <h3 id="why-it-happens"><strong>Why It Happens:</strong></h3> <ul> <li>In CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance), stations listen to the medium before transmitting. If D hears A’s transmission to B, it assumes the medium is busy and waits, even though D’s transmission wouldn’t cause a collision at B (or any other relevant receiver).</li> <li>This conservative approach to carrier sensing can lead to inefficiency, as D delays its transmission unnecessarily, even when it could communicate with another station without interference.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="use-of-handshaking-rtscts-in-the-exposed-station-problem"><strong>Use of Handshaking (RTS/CTS) in the Exposed Station Problem</strong></h3> <p>Unlike the hidden station problem, the RTS/CTS (Request to Send/Clear to Send) handshake does not directly solve or mitigate the exposed station problem. In fact, it can sometimes exacerbate it. Here’s why and how it works in this context:</p> <h4 id="how-rtscts-works-in-general"><strong>How RTS/CTS Works in General</strong></h4> <ul> <li>In CSMA/CA, a station (e.g., A) wanting to transmit to B sends an RTS frame, and B responds with a CTS frame. The Duration field in RTS and CTS sets the NAV (Network Allocation Vector) for other stations, preventing them from transmitting during the reserved time.</li> <li>This handshake is effective for avoiding collisions from hidden stations (as seen in the hidden station problem) by ensuring all stations near the receiver (B) defer transmission.</li> </ul> <h4 id="impact-on-exposed-stations"><strong>Impact on Exposed Stations</strong></h4> <ul> <li><strong>No Direct Solution</strong>: The RTS/CTS mechanism doesn’t address the exposed station problem because it reserves the medium for a longer duration, potentially causing more stations (like D) to defer unnecessarily, even if their transmissions wouldn’t interfere.</li> <li>For example, in the scenario where A sends RTS to B and B responds with CTS, Station D (within A’s range) hears the CTS and sets its NAV, deferring its transmission. However, D could safely transmit to another station outside B’s range without causing a collision, but the NAV forces it to wait, worsening the exposed station issue.</li> <li><strong>Potential Exacerbation</strong>: The additional overhead of RTS/CTS (extra frames and delays) can further reduce efficiency in networks with exposed stations, as it increases the time the medium appears busy, leading to more unnecessary deferrals.</li> </ul> <h4 id="why-rtscts-doesnt-help"><strong>Why RTS/CTS Doesn’t Help</strong></h4> <ul> <li>The exposed station problem stems from the conservative nature of carrier sensing in CSMA/CA, where a station defers even when its transmission wouldn’t interfere. RTS/CTS reinforces this conservatism by broadcasting the medium reservation, but it doesn’t distinguish between stations that would cause interference and those that wouldn’t.</li> <li>The handshake assumes all stations within range of the sender (A) or receiver (B) should defer, which is overly restrictive for exposed stations like D.</li> </ul> <p><img src="/static/Pasted-image-20250223184617.png" alt="Pasted-image-20250223184617"></p> <p><img src="/static/Pasted-image-20250223184627.png" alt="Pasted-image-20250223184627"></p> <h2 id="ieee-80211-fhss-physical-layer"><strong>IEEE 802.11 FHSS physical layer</strong></h2> <p><img src="/static/Pasted-image-20250223184754.png" alt="Pasted-image-20250223184754"></p> <ul> <li><strong>Overview</strong>: Illustrates the Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) physical layer in IEEE 802.11, operating in the 2.4 GHz band with data rates of 1 or 2 Mbps.</li> <li><strong>Digital Data Input</strong>: Accepts 1 or 2 Mbps digital data from the MAC layer for transmission.</li> <li><strong>Modulator (2-Level or 4-Level FSK)</strong>: Converts digital data into a 1-MHz analog signal using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK): <ul> <li>2-Level FSK for 1 Mbps (two frequencies for 0 and 1).</li> <li>4-Level FSK for 2 Mbps (four frequencies for bit combinations).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Pseudorandom Sequence</strong>: Generates a pseudorandom hopping pattern to switch frequencies, enhancing security and reducing interference.</li> <li><strong>Frequency Synthesizer</strong>: Uses the pseudorandom sequence to dynamically adjust the carrier frequency, hopping across 1-MHz channels at ~2.5 hops/second.</li> <li><strong>Analog Signal Output</strong>: Produces a 1-MHz analog signal for wireless transmission, spread across frequencies to resist interference and multipath fading.</li> <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Reduces interference, improves robustness, and coexists with other 2.4 GHz devices.</li> <li><strong>Limitations</strong>: Low data rates (1–2 Mbps), hardware complexity, and obsolescence compared to modern Wi-Fi standards.</li> </ul> <h2 id="physical-layer-of-ieee-80211-dsss"><strong>Physical layer of IEEE 802.11 DSSS</strong></h2> <p><img src="/static/Pasted-image-20250223184812.png" alt="Pasted-image-20250223184812"></p> <ul> <li><strong>Overview</strong>: Illustrates the Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) physical layer in IEEE 802.11, operating in the 2.4 GHz band with data rates of 1 or 2 Mbps.</li> <li><strong>Digital Data Input</strong>: Accepts 1 or 2 Mbps digital data from the MAC layer for transmission.</li> <li><strong>11-Chip Barker Sequence</strong>: Spreads the digital data using an 11-chip Barker sequence, increasing the signal bandwidth to 11 Mbps (spreading) while maintaining the original data rate, improving resistance to interference and noise.</li> <li><strong>Modulator (BPSK or QPSK)</strong>: Converts the spread data into an 11-MHz analog signal using phase modulation: <ul> <li>BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) for 1 Mbps (one bit per symbol).</li> <li>QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) for 2 Mbps (two bits per symbol).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Analog Signal Output</strong>: Produces an 11-MHz analog signal for wireless transmission, spread across a wider frequency band to enhance reliability and reduce interference.</li> <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Offers better interference resistance and robustness than FHSS, simpler hardware than frequency hopping, and supports coexistence in the 2.4 GHz band.</li> <li><strong>Limitations</strong>: Lower data rates (1–2 Mbps) compared to modern Wi-Fi standards, and susceptibility to multipath fading, though less than FHSS.
